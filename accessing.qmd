# Data accessing {#access00}

Surveys serve as a pivotal tool for collecting and evaluating health-related information on a national scale. More often than not, it's the governmental bodies that take the lead in gathering this data. Recognizing the value of this information, many governments not only compile and analyze these datasets but also ensure they are accessible to the public, especially for research purposes. In this guide, we will delve into an array of survey methodologies, provide illustrative examples, and guide you through the process of downloading pertinent data from both Canadian and American repositories. To make this more tangible, we will conclude with a hands-on example, showcasing how to replicate findings from an academic paper that leveraged one of these publicly available datasets.

## Clinical implication {.unnumbered}

### ML in clinical settings

We could have the following uses of ML methods in the clinical settings:

-   **prescreen** patients to identify high-risk patient pool.
    -   warn patients about imminent risk
    -   helps manage clinical workload
-   help **diagnose** a disease better with high accuracy
    -   could be based on radiology or pathology images
    -   could prevent mis-diagnose by giving a second opinion
    -   could indicate suspicious regions, assisting clinicians to focus on the most important considerations
-   **Monitoring** vulnerable patients
    -   monitoring devices (e.g., fall detection)
    -   ethical, moral and transparency considerations

### Model updating

-   **Updating** risk prediction model based on new data
    -   could be automated given access to continuously collected data
-   policy could change, requiring the update of the model

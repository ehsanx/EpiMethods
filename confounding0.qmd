## Confounding

Confounding is a pervasive concern in epidemiology, especially in observational studies focusing on causality. Epidemiologists need to carefully select confounders to avoid biased results due to third factors affecting the relationship between exposure and outcome. Commonly used methods for selecting confounders, such as change-in-estimator or solely relying on p-value-based statistical methods, may be inadequate or even problematic.

Epidemiologists need a more formalized system for confounder selection, incorporating causal diagrams and counterfactual reasoning. This includes an understanding of the underlying causal relationships and the potential impacts of different variables on the observed association. Understanding the temporal order and causal pathways is crucial for accurate confounder control.

However, it is possible that epidemiologists may lack comprehensive knowledge about the causal roles of all variables and hence may need to resort to empirical criteria such as the disjunctive cause criterion, or other variable selection methods such as machine learning approaches. While these methods can provide more sophisticated analyses and help address the high dimensionality and complex structures of modern epidemiological data, epidemiologists need to understand how these approaches function, along with their benefits and limitations, to avoid introducing additional bias into the analysis.

### Modelling criteria for variable selection
Most of these modelling criteria work when we are only dealing with confounders (some important ones, and some less so), or maybe risk factors of the outcomes. But no mediators, or colliders.

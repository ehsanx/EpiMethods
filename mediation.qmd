# Mediation analysis {.unnumbered}

## Background

This chapter provides comprehensive tutorials on mediation analysis. The Baron and Kenny approach explores non-binary outcomes through directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and regression in big data scenarios, with a focus on both continuous and binary mediators and outcomes. The justification of mediation analysis evaluates the connection between osteoarthritis (OA), pain medication, and cardiovascular disease (CVD), considering various covariates like BMI, smoking status, and associations with diseases like diabetes. The final mediation example centers on decomposing the total effect of OA on CVD through direct and indirect pathways via pain medication, including data preparation, weight computation, and outcome evaluation, accompanied by considerations of non-linearity and potential interactions.

## Overview of tutorials

::: column-margin
In the preceding [chapters](propensityscore.html), we have primarily discussed about total effect of an exposure to the outcome. In this chapter, we will discuss about decomposition of the effect in the presence of a [mediator](confounding2.html).

### [Baron and Kenny Approach](mediation1.html)

The chapter, referencing the Baron and Kenny approach, delves into the analysis of non-binary outcomes using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and regression techniques for big data scenarios with a million observations. Initially, the chapter focuses on a continuous outcome and continuous mediator, where the true treatment effect is known. Through the data generating process, a DAG is formulated and data simulated, followed by an estimation of effects using generalized linear models. Subsequently, the Baron and Kenny approaches are applied to determine direct, total, and indirect effects. The chapter progresses to explore binary outcomes with both continuous and binary mediators, each time employing a similar approach: creating a DAG, generating data, estimating effects using regression models, and then using the Baron and Kenny methodology to elucidate the relationships.

### [Justification of Mediation Analysis](mediation2.html)

In this chapter, the data analysis process centers on understanding the relationship between osteoarthritis (OA), pain medication, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) using a mediation analysis. Specifically, the analysis seeks to determine if OA, the exposure, is associated with an increased risk of CVD, the outcome. Additionally, it investigates whether pain medication acts as a mediator in this causal pathway. The total effect of OA on CVD risk was found to be significant. Furthermore, OA was observed to significantly influence the use of pain medication, which is the proposed mediator. To facilitate the analysis, the study considers various adjustment covariates, including demographic variables, confounders such as BMI and smoking status, and associations with other diseases like diabetes. The data used in this study is pre-processed, analyzed, and subsequently saved for further use.

### [Mediation Example](mediation3.html)

In the chapter, the focus is on decomposing the "total effect" of a given exposure, OA ($A$), on the outcome CVD ($Y$) into its natural direct effect (NDE; $A \rightarrow Y$) and a natural indirect effect (NIE) that routes through a mediator, in this case, pain medication ($M$). Initially, the required data is loaded and preprocessed. The mediation analysis involves several steps: (1) Preparing the data and ensuring it has the necessary variables; (2) Modifying data for different exposures and duplicating it; (3) Computing weights for the mediation based on logistic regressions, where the weights are applied to factor in the mediator's effect; (4) Building a weighted outcome model, which is a logistic regression to evaluate the outcome. To quantify these effects, the chapter derives point estimates for the total effect, direct effect, and indirect effect. Furthermore, confidence intervals for these effects are determined using bootstrap methods. The results, including the proportion mediated by pain medication, are visualized using graphs. The chapter also delves into considerations of non-linearity and potential interactions between variables.

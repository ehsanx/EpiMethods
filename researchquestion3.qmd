## Causal question-1 {.unnumbered}

### Working with a Predictive question using CCHS

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
require(survey)
use.saved.chche <- TRUE
```

### Load data

We download and process the data in the same was as shown [earlier](accessing2.html), and reuse the data for the following tutorial.

```{r loading, eval=TRUE, cache=use.saved.chche }
load(file = "Data/researchquestion/cchsc1.RData")
load(file = "Data/researchquestion/cchsc2.RData")
load(file = "Data/researchquestion/cchsc3.RData")
ls() # see list of objects available
dim(c1) # Dimensions of CCHS 1.1
dim(c2) # Dimensions of CCHS 2.1
dim(c3) # Dimensions of CCHS 3.1
```

### Aim

Rheumatic diseases may cause acute or chronic inflammation. Such systemic inflammation could increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). However, Osteoarthritis (OA) is not so well explored in association with CVD. The aim of the current study is to examine the association between OA and CVD among Canadian adults.

### Example article

We are going to use the article by @rahman2013relationship as our reference. [DOI:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-002624](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/3/5/e002624).

We will revisit this question and data again in the [survey data](surveydata1.html) chapter.

#### PICOT

-   Target population: Canadian adults

-   Outcome ($Y$): CVD (Heart disease)

-   Exposure group ($A$): OA

-   Control group: People without OA

-   Time line: From 2001 - 2005

-   From the literature, we have identified some factors to be useful in exploring this $A-Y$ relationship:

    ```         
    - age, 
    - sex, 
    - income, 
    - ethnicity,
    - obesity,
    - exercise,
    - smoking,
    - diets (Proxied by fruit and vegetable consumption),
    - pain medication use,
    - hypertension,
    - cholesterol (Proxied by Diabetes and Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease /COPD),
    - Additionally we have considered education level. 
    ```

#### Why this time frame?

In CCHS cycle 1.1-3.1, there was a question 'What type of arthritis?' - which resulted in responses such as

-   Rheumatoid arthritis,
-   OA,
-   other,
-   unknown.

This question was crucial in identifying OA patients. However, in later years, that question was omitted. Hence, for this practical reason, we restricted out analysis in CCHS cycle 1.1-3.1 (2001-2005).

### Creating Analytic Data

#### Identify Relevant factors

From the literature, we identify variables that are associated with either the outcome and/or the exposure. We have to be cautious about the variables that are only related to exposures only (a topic for later).

Generally try to include basic demographics (e.g., age, sex, education etc. are the usual suspects) at this stage even if we do not have a strong indication from the literature that those variables are highly associated with the outcome or the exposure.

#### Variables under consideration

Find out whether we have the variables collected / measured / asked in the surveys. If not asked, try to find out whether there is a proxy variable that was collected / measured / asked in the surveys.

For example, we did not have a question / variable related to a particular topic (e.g., say, cholesterol, which is known to be associated with our outcome), try to collect some variables that could be used as proxies (e.g., COPD, Diabetes).

Note that the variable names are generally different in different cycles.

#### Subset the data

```{r subset, eval=TRUE, cache=use.saved.chche }
# Restrict the dataset with variables of interest only

#### Combine 3 cycle datasets

We want to combine data from three different cycles in order to get more subjects in our data. For that, we will have to stack/append data from three different cycles. In order to do so, we need to make the names exarctly the same. E.g., for BMI category, we will rename all 3 variables: `HWTAGSW` (from cycle 1), `HWTCGISW` (from cycle 2) and `HWTEGISW` (from cycle 3) to `bmicat`.

Generally I prefer smaller cases for names, but that's just my coding preference.

##### Making variable names the same

```{r namesx, eval=TRUE, cache=use.saved.chche }
new.var.names <- c("arthritis", "arthritis.kind", "CVD", "age", 
               "sex", "income", "race", "bmi", 
               "bmicat", "phyact", "smoke", "fruit", 
               "painmed", "ht", "copd", "diab",  
               "edu", "weight")
names(cc11) <- names(cc21) <- names(cc31) <- new.var.names

table(cc11$arthritis)
table(cc21$arthritis)
table(cc31$arthritis)
```

##### Notice the difference in categorization

Note that, not only the names of the variables are different, sometimes, the categorization labels are also different. Note the BMI (Category) in the three cycles: `HWTAGSW` from cycle 1:

```{r bmicat1, echo=FALSE, out.width = '65%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/researchquestion/bmicat1.png")
```

`HWTCGISW` from cycle 2:

```{r bmicat2, echo=FALSE, out.width = '65%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/researchquestion/bmicat2.png")
```

`HWTEGISW` from cycle 3:

```{r bmicat3, echo=FALSE, out.width = '65%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/researchquestion/bmicat3.png")
```

```{r names2x, eval=TRUE, cache=use.saved.chche }
table(cc11$bmicat)
table(cc21$bmicat)
table(cc31$bmicat)
```

In cycle 1.1, the second response (code 2) label was named as "Acceptable weight" where as in cycles 2.1 and 3.1 it was named as "Normal weight". Also "obese" category was not present in cycle 1.1.

Similarly look for age categories:

```{r age1, echo=FALSE, out.width = '65%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/researchquestion/age1.png")
```

```{r age2, echo=FALSE, out.width = '65%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/researchquestion/age2.png")
```

```{r age3, echo=FALSE, out.width = '65%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/researchquestion/age3.png")
```

Similarly look for income categories:

```{r income1, echo=FALSE, out.width = '65%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/researchquestion/income1.png")
```

```{r income2, echo=FALSE, out.width = '65%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/researchquestion/income2.png")
```

```{r income3, echo=FALSE, out.width = '65%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/researchquestion/income3.png")
```

Therefore, we need to recode the variable value labels carefully.

##### Appending

Below we append all the three cycles of data:

```{r recode0all, eval=TRUE, cache=use.saved.chche }
cc123a <- rbind(cc11,cc21,cc31)
```

### Subsetting according to eligibility criteria

#### Criteria 1: control group

Exposure group is people with osteoarthritis. The control group is people who do not have osteoarthritis.

In cycle 1, there were 2 related questions: - Do you have arthritis or rheumatism excluding fibromyalgia? (variable `arthritis`) - What kind of arthritis do you have? (variable `arthritis.kind`)

```{r recode0, eval=TRUE, cache=use.saved.chche }
table(cc123a$arthritis)
table(cc123a$arthritis.kind)
dim(cc123a)
```

In the control group, we do not want to put people with other types of arthritis.

```{r recode0a, eval=TRUE, cache=use.saved.chche }
c123sub1 <- subset(cc123a, arthritis.kind == "OSTEOARTHRITIS" | 
                    arthritis.kind == "NOT APPLICABLE" )
dim(c123sub1)
table(c123sub1$arthritis.kind)
table(c123sub1$arthritis)
require(car)
c123sub1$arthritis.kind <- recode(c123sub1$arthritis.kind, 
                        "'OSTEOARTHRITIS'='OA';
                         'NOT APPLICABLE'='Control';
                         else=NA",
                         as.factor = FALSE)
table(c123sub1$arthritis.kind, useNA = "always")
c123sub1$OA <- c123sub1$arthritis.kind
c123sub1$arthritis.kind <- NULL
c123sub1$arthritis <- NULL
```

#### Criteria 2: retain valid responses for outcome

```{r recode0b, eval=TRUE, cache=use.saved.chche }
table(c123sub1$CVD)
c123sub2 <- subset(c123sub1, CVD == "YES" | CVD == "NO")
table(c123sub2$CVD)
dim(c123sub2)
c123sub2$CVD <- recode(c123sub2$CVD, 
                        "'YES'='event';
                         'NO'='0 event';
                         else=NA",
                         as.factor = FALSE)
table(c123sub2$CVD, useNA = "always")
```

#### Criteria 3: Is there a zero cell?

Check out 'Universe' for all the variables under consideration. Is there a possibility that cross-tabulation of some of the categories will produce zero?

For example, the 'Universe' for BMI or BMI category includes 'Respondents aged 20 to 64'.

```{r bmi1, echo=FALSE, out.width = '65%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/researchquestion/bmi1.png")
```

Therefore, we will not have BMI from anyone aged less than 20 or over 64.

```{r recode0c, eval=TRUE, cache=use.saved.chche }
table(c123sub2$bmicat, c123sub2$age)[,1:2]
# Note the categories of bmicat (duplicate categories) 
```

Also, we check the prevalence of OA and CVD for subjects less than 20 years of age: not a lot of people (still potential for a sensitivity analysis).

```{r recode0d, eval=TRUE, cache=use.saved.chche }
table(c123sub2$OA, c123sub2$age)
table(c123sub2$CVD, c123sub2$age)
```

Accordingly, we will restrict our analysis (and aim) to adult target population only (age 20 and +). For that, first, recode the age variable, and then exclude the `teen` category.

```{r recode1, eval=TRUE, cache=use.saved.chche }
# CCHS cycle 1.1 has: '15 TO 19 YEARS'
# Other cycles have: '15 TO 17 YEARS', '18 TO 19 YEARS'
c123sub2$age <- recode(c123sub2$age, 
                        "c('12 TO 14 YEARS','15 TO 19 YEARS',
                         '15 TO 17 YEARS', '18 TO 19 YEARS')='teen';
                         c('20 TO 24 YEARS','25 TO 29 YEARS',
                           '30 TO 34 YEARS','35 TO 39 YEARS')='20-39 years';
                         c('40 TO 44 YEARS','45 TO 49 YEARS')='40-49 years';
                         c('50 TO 54 YEARS','55 TO 59 YEARS')='50-59 years';
                         c('60 TO 64 YEARS')='60-64 years';   
                         else='65 years and over'",
                         as.factor = FALSE)
table(c123sub2$age)
dim(c123sub2)
c123sub3 <- subset(c123sub2, age != 'teen' & age != '65 years and over')
table(c123sub3$age, useNA = "always")
dim(c123sub3)
```

#### Criteria 4: Assign missing to the invalid covariate responses

```{r recode2, eval=TRUE, cache=use.saved.chche }

table(c123sub3$sex)
c123sub3$sex <- car::recode(c123sub3$sex,

## Naive Analysis of combined 3 cycles

In the current analysis, we will simply consider all of the variables under consideration as 'confounders', and include in our analysis. Later we will perform a refined analysis.

### Summary of the analytic data

#### Including missing values

```{r analytic0, eval=TRUE, cache=use.saved.chche }
dim(c123sub3)
analytic <- c123sub3
dim(analytic)

require("tableone")
CreateTableOne(vars = c("CVD", "age", 
               "sex", "income", "race", 
               "bmicat", "phyact", "smoke", "fruit", 
               "painmed", "ht", "copd", "diab", "edu"),
               data = analytic, includeNA = TRUE)
CreateTableOne(vars = c("CVD", "age", 
               "sex", "income", "race",
               "bmicat", "phyact", "smoke", "fruit", 
               "painmed", "ht", "copd", "diab", "edu"),
               data = analytic, strata = "OA", includeNA = TRUE)
require(DataExplorer)
plot_missing(analytic)
```

Let us investigate why pain medication has so much missing

```{r pain1, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/researchquestion/pain1.png")
```

```{r pain2, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/researchquestion/pain2.png")
```

```{r pain3, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/researchquestion/pain3.png")
```

Optional content respondent (cycle 3.1):

```{r optional3, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/researchquestion/optional3.png")
```

In cycle 2.1, only 21,755 out of 134,072 responded to optional medication component.

#### Complete case analysis

```{r analytic1, eval=TRUE, cache=use.saved.chche }
dim(c123sub3)
analytic2 <- as.data.frame(na.omit(c123sub3))
dim(analytic2)


tab1 <- CreateTableOne(vars = c("CVD", "age", 
               "sex", "income", "race", 
               "bmicat", "phyact", "smoke", "fruit", 
               "painmed", "ht", "copd", "diab", "edu"),
               data = analytic2, includeNA = TRUE)
print(tab1, showAllLevels = TRUE)
tab1b <- CreateTableOne(vars = c("CVD", "age", 
               "sex", "income", "race",
               "bmicat", "phyact", "smoke", "fruit", 
               "painmed", "ht", "copd", "diab", "edu"),
               data = analytic2, strata = "OA", includeNA = TRUE)
print(tab1b, showAllLevels = TRUE)
```

## Save data for later

```{r analytic4, eval=TRUE, cache=use.saved.chche }
save(analytic, analytic2, cc123a, file = "Data/researchquestion/OA123CVD.RData")
```

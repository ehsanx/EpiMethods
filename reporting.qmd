## Overview of tutorials

### [Git and GitHub](reporting1.html)

This tutorial introduces the fundamentals of Git and GitHub as essential tools for version control and collaborative research. It explains how Git tracks changes over time, enabling reproducibility and accountability in manuscript writing, while GitHub serves as a cloud-based platform to host and manage Git repositories. 

### [Configure Git in RStudio](reporting1a.html)

Learn how to configure Git by linking your GitHub credentials to RStudio. This is a necessary step for making authenticated changes to remote repositories.

### [Create and Clone a Git Repository](reporting1b.html)

Understand how to create a repository on GitHub and "clone" it locally. This step sets up the shared workspace for manuscript development.

### [Updating Repository Contents from RStudio](reporting1c.html)

Gain familiarity with essential Git commands—`pull`, `commit`, and `push`—for synchronizing changes and managing version control across collaborators.

### [Formatting Resources](reporting2.html)

This section provides a wealth of tools and platforms beneficial for researchers and writers in managing and creating scientific documents. It encompasses LaTex and ShareLaTeX for document preparation, TablesGenerator for converting tables from MS Word to various formats, and R packages like "officer" and "flextable" for generating tables and charts. It also introduces draw.io for crafting flow charts, platforms like jane for identifying suitable journals, officetimeline for creating Gantt charts, and Google Docs for real-time collaborative writing. Moreover, it highlights Zotero and ZoteroBib as comprehensive tools for reference management and bibliography creation, facilitating organized, collaborative, and streamlined research and writing processes.

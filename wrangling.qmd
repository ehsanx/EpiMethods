# Data wrangling {#lab00}

## Description

Tutorials in this chapter offer step-by-step instructions and code examples to help you understand and implement various data manipulation and import techniques in R.

### R Basics

This tutorial introduces the basics of R programming. It covers topics such as setting up R and RStudio, using R as a calculator, creating variables, working with vectors, plotting data, and accessing help resources.


### R Data Types

This tutorial covers three primary data structures in R: matrices, lists, and data frames. Matrices are two-dimensional arrays with elements of the same type, and their manipulation includes reshaping and combining. Lists in R are versatile collections that can store various R objects, including matrices. Data frames, on the other hand, are akin to matrices but permit columns of diverse data types. The tutorial offers guidance on creating, modifying, and merging data frames and checking their dimensions.

### Automating Tasks

Medical data analysis often grapples with vast and intricate data sets. Manual handling isn't just tedious; it's error-prone, especially given the critical decisions hinging on the results. This tutorial introduces automation techniques in R, a leading language for statistical analysis. By learning to use loops and functions, you can automate repetitive tasks, minimize errors, and conduct analyses more efficiently. Dive in to enhance your data handling skills.

### Importing Dataset

This tutorial focuses on importing data into R. It demonstrates how to import data from CSV and SAS formats using functions like read.csv and sasxport.get. It also includes examples of loading specific variables, dropping variables, subsetting observations based on certain criteria, and handling missing values.

### Data Manipulation

This tutorial explores various data manipulation techniques in R. It covers topics such as dropping variables from a dataset, keeping specific variables, subsetting observations based on specific criteria, converting variable types (e.g., factors, strings), and handling missing values.

### Import External Data

This tutorial provides examples of importing external data into R. It includes specific examples of importing a CSV file (Employee Salaries - 2017 data) and a SAS file (NHANES 2015-2016 data). It also demonstrates how to save a working dataset in different formats, such as CSV and RData.

### Summary Tables

This tutorial emphasizes the importance of data summarization in medical research and epidemiology, specifically how to summarize medical data using R. It demonstrates creating "Table 1", a typical descriptive statistics table in research papers, with examples that use the built-in R functions and specialized packages to efficiently summarize and stratify data.

The relationship between sense of community belonging and self-rated mental health among Canadians with mental or substance use disorders. Journal of Mental Health, 29(2): 168–175. DOI: 10.1080/09638237.2018.1437602\n\nWe will go through the exercise questions and evaluate how well Gemini performs on each task. These tasks include applying eligibility criteria, subsetting the data in terms of variables and retaining those necessary for analysis, creating an analytic dataset, creating a Table 1, and building a logistic regression model, and presenting odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Additionally, we will use what we learned from the previous tutorial [(found here)](.) to streamline these exercises.\n\nIn this part of the tutorial, we will go through the first set of tasks, which includes loading, subsetting the data according to eligibility criteria and necessary variables, creating an analytic dataset, and reporting the number of columns and variable names in this dataset. These tutorials were completed in RStudio [@rstudio] using R version 4.3.2 [@r], with the following packages: dplyr [@dplyr], car [@car], and forcats [@forecats].\n\nFor this tutorial, I used Gemini’s free 2.5 Flash model.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\\\n\n### Load data and required packages\n\nThe data used in this exercise can be found [here](https://github.com/ehsanx/EpiMethods/tree/main/LabExercises/accessingEx/Data/accessing).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npackages <- c(\"dplyr\", \"car\", \"forcats\")\n\nlapply(packages, function(pkg) {\n  if (!require(pkg, character.only = TRUE)) install.packages(pkg, dependencies = TRUE)\n  library(pkg, character.only = TRUE)\n})\n\ndirectory <- \"Data/accessing\"  # Enter the path to your working directory here\n\nload(paste0(directory, \"/cchsMH.RData\"))\n\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe data dictionary for this dataset can be found [here](https://datalib.usask.ca/dli/health/cchs/2012-mh/doc/cchs_mh_datadictionary.pdf). Download this, as we will need to send it to Gemini.\n\n(Note that in the exercise, exercise 1a is for loading the dataset. We will start at 1b as we have already loaded the data)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\\\n\n### Exercise 1b: Subsetting according to eligibility\n\nFor the second exercise, we will subset the data based on the eligibility criteria outlined in the article. We'll send the following prompt, along with the article, to see if Gemini can identify the correct eligibility criteria. In addition to the article, we will also provide the data dictionary.\n\nTo ensure Gemini has access to the necessary information, we will begin by sending this prompt to ask what the eligibility criteria are in the paper.\n\n\\\n**Prompt Sent to Gemini:**\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"User Prompt\"}\nIn the paper *\"The relationship between sense of community belonging and self-rated mental health among Canadians with mental or substance use disorders\"* by **Palis, Marchand & Oviedo-Joekes**, what **eligibility criteria** were applied to define the analytic sample?\n\n-   Refer to the **first paragraph of the \"Analytic sample\" section** on **page 2** of the paper.\n\n-   Based on the criteria described there, identify the **specific variable** from the **data dictionary** that should be used to subset the dataset in R.\n:::\n\n\\\n**Gemini's response:**\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Gemini Response\"}\nThe eligibility criteria applied to define the analytic sample in the paper \"The relationship between sense of community belonging and self-rated mental health among Canadians with mental or substance use disorders\" were restricted to respondents who reported experiencing at least one of the following mental or substance use disorders (MSUDs) in the previous 12 months: a mood disorder (such as a major depressive episode, bipolar disorder, or mania), generalized anxiety disorder, or substance abuse or dependence (involving alcohol, cannabis, or other drugs).\\\n\\\nBased on these criteria, the specific variable from the data dictionary that should be used to subset the dataset in R is **MHPFY**. You should select observations where `MHPFY` has a code of **1** (indicating \"YES\" for having any selected disorder in the past 12 months).\n:::\n\n\\\n\nBased on the data dictionary, this variable fits the description of the eligibility criteria. Gemini successfully identified the correct variable to use. Now, let's ask Gemini for the R code to subset the data based on this eligibility criteria.\n\n\\\n**Prompt Sent to Gemini:**\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"User Prompt\"}\nUsing **RStudio**, apply the eligibility criteria to the `cmh` dataset by subsetting the data to include only respondents who meet the condition specified in the **Analytic sample** section of the paper.\n\n-   Retain only those coded as **\"YES\"** on the eligibility variable.\n\n-   Provide the R code to complete this task.\n\n-   The `dplyr` package has already been loaded\n:::\n\n\\\n**Gemini's response:**\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Gemini Response\"}\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Subset the cmh dataset to include only respondents who meet the eligibility criteria (MHPFY == 1)\ncmh_analytic_sample <- cmh %>%\n  filter(MHPFY == \"YES\")\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\n\\\nGreat, the code provided by Gemini successfully filtered the dataset to include only eligible respondents.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\\\n\n### Exercise 1c: Retaining necessary variables\n\nFor the second task, we will be keeping only the variables we need for the analysis. Specifically, retain only the variables associated with the outcome measure, explanatory variable, potential confounders, and survey weight. There should be eight variables (one outcome, one exposure, five confounders, and one survey weight).\n\nWe need to:\n\n-   Identify the outcome variable\n\n-   Identify the explanatory variable\n\n-   Identify the potential confounders\n\n-   Identify the survey weight variable\n\nThe study variables are mentioned in the paper. Specifically, the first and second paragraphs of the study variables section mentions the outcome, explanatory and confounding variables, and the third paragraph of the statistical analyses section mentions the survey weights variable.\n\nI will send the following prompt to Gemini for this task. All previous information that we have sent should help Gemini choose the correct variables.\n\n\\\n**Prompt Sent to Gemini:**\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"User Prompt\"}\nRetain only the variables associated with the **outcome**, **explanatory variable**, **potential confounders**, and **survey weight** from the dataset. There should be **eight variables total**:\n\n-   1 outcome variable\n\n-   1 explanatory variable\n\n-   5 confounders\n\n-   1 survey weight variable\n\nFollow these steps:\n\n-   Identify the **outcome variable**\n\n-   Identify the **explanatory variable**\n\n-   Identify the **five potential confounders**\n\n-   Identify the **survey weight variable**\n\n**Hint:**\n\n-   Refer to the **first and second paragraphs** of the *Study variables* section for the outcome, explanatory, and confounding variables.\n\n-   Refer to the **third paragraph** of the *Statistical analyses* section to determine the survey weight variable.\n\nOnce you have established the variables, subset the data and rename the variables for simplicity.\n:::\n\n\\\n**Gemini's response:**\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Gemini Response\"}\nTo subset your cmh dataset and retain only the variables associated with the outcome, explanatory variable, potential confounders, and the survey weight, follow the R code below.\n\nHere are the identified variables:\n\n-   **Outcome Variable:** `SCR_082` (Self-perceived mental health)\n\n    -   *Reference:* Page 16 of the CCHS-MH Data Dictionary\n\n-   **Explanatory Variable:** `GEN_10` (Sense of belonging to local community)\n\n    -   *Reference:* Page 14 of the CCHS-MH Data Dictionary\n\n-   **Confounders (5 variables):**\n\n    -   Age: `DHHGAGE` (Age grouped variable)\n\n        -   *Reference:* Page 4 of the CCHS-MH Data Dictionary\n\n    -   Sex: `DHH_SEX` (Sex)\n\n        -   *Reference:* Page 5 of the CCHS-MH Data Dictionary\n\n    -   Cultural or Racial Identity: `SDCGCGT` (Grouped visible minority).

Gemini correctly identified the appropriate variables based on the data dictionary and provided code that executed successfully, along with functions to verify the output.\n\n\\\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\\\n\n### Exercise 1d: Creating analytic dataset\n\nFor the third task, we will be creating an analytic dataset.\n\nThe outcome variable has a category ‘NOT STATED’, but for our analysis, we will omit anyone associated with this category. Similarly, for the explanatory variable, we have categories such as DON’T KNOW, REFUSAL, and NOT STATED. We will omit anyone with these categories.\n\nWhat we want to do is:\n\n-   Assign missing values for categories such as DON’T KNOW, REFUSAL, and NOT STATED.\n-   Recode the variables as shown in Table 1 in the article. You can use any function/package of your choice. Here is an example (but feel free to use other functions. In R, there are many other ways to do this same task.\n\nI will send the following prompt, along with the levels for each of the updated variables. Additionally, I will send the Table 1.\n\n\\\n**Prompt Sent to Gemini:**\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"User Prompt\"}\nCreate an analytic dataset.\n\n-   The outcome variable contains a \"NOT STATED\" category.

In all instances, Gemini accurately identified the correct variables based on the data dictionary. It also successfully created the analytic dataset using the exclusion criteria and correctly recoded the variables.\n\n\\\n[**What Worked Well**]{.underline}\n\n-   Successfully created the analytic dataset when it understood which variables to use.\n\n\\\n\nWhile Gemini was successful during these exercises, it's important not to assume that AI tools will always produce correct results. They are prone to errors and can sometimes fill in gaps when information is missing, which may lead to inaccurate outputs. Always review, validate, and test results before relying on them, especially in cases where precision is critical.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\\\n\n### In the Next Tutorial\n\nIn the next tutorial, we will evaluate how well Gemini performs in generating a Table 1, performing logistic regression, and producing odds ratios and confidence intervals. We will save the data we have created to our working directory so we can load it for the next tutorial.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsave(analytic_data, file = paste0(directory, \"/analytic_data.RData\"))\n\n```\n:::\n\n\n## References\n",

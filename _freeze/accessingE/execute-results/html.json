You can download all of the related files in a zip file **accessingEx.zip** from [Github folder](https://github.com/ehsanx/EpiMethods/tree/main/LabExercises/), or just by clicking this link [directly](https://github.com/ehsanx/EpiMethods/raw/main/LabExercises/accessingEx.zip).\n\n-   Navigate to the GitHub folder (above link) where the ZIP file is located.\n-   Click on the file name (above zip file) to open its preview window.\n-   Click on the Download button to download the file. If you can't see the Download button, click on \"Download Raw File\" link that should appear on the page.\n:::\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nWe will use the article by @palis2020relationship, [DOI: 10.1080/09638237.2018.1437602](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Heather_Palis/publication/323136807_The_relationship_between_sense_of_community_belonging_and_self-rated_mental_health_among_Canadians_with_mental_or_substance_use_disorders/links/5a96ff210f7e9ba42974c0dd/The-relationship-between-sense-of-community-belonging-and-self-rated-mental-health-among-Canadians-with-mental-or-substance-use-disorders.pdf).\n\n-   Download the [CCHS MH topical index](https://gsg.uottawa.ca/data/teaching/escc-cchs/fmgd_pumf/2012/cchs_mh_topical_index.pdf)\n-   Download the [CCHS MH Data Dictionary](https://gsg.uottawa.ca/data/teaching/escc-cchs/fmgd_pumf/2012/cchs_mh_datadictionary.pdf)\n\n## Question 1: \\[60% grade\\]\n\n### 1(a) Importing dataset\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Importing dataset\nload(\"Data/accessing/cchsMH.RData\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n### 1(b) Subsetting according to eligibility\n\nSubset the dataset according to the eligibility criteria / restriction specified in the paper\n\n-   Identify the variable needed for eligibility criteria\n\n**Hint**\n\n-   Read the first paragraph of **Analytic sample** (page 2) for the eligibility criteria\n-   Eligibility criteria was determined based on only **one** variable. Only work with 'YES' category.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# your code here\n\n```\n:::\n\n\n### 1(c) Retaining necessary variables\n\nIn the dataset, retain only the variables associated with outcome measure, explanatory variable, potential confounders and survey weight. There should be eight variables (one outcome, one exposure, five confounders, and one survey weight).\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n-   Identify the outcome variable\n\n-   Identify the explanatory variable\n\n-   Identify the potential confounders\n\n-   Identify the survey weight variable\n\n-   **Hint**\n\n    1.  Read\n\n    -   first and second paragraphs of **Study variables** for the outcome, explanatory and confounding variables\n    -   third paragraph of the **Statistical analyses** for the survey weights variable.\n\n    2.  There were **five** potential confounders.\n    3.

Similarly, for explanatory variable, we have categories such as DON'T KNOW, REFUSAL and NOT STATED. We will omit anyone with these categories.\n\n-   Assign missing values for categories such as DON'T KNOW, REFUSAL and NOT STATED.\n-   Recode the variables as shown in Table 1 in the article. You can use any function/package of your choice. Here is an example (but feel free to use other functions.

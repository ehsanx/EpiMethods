Read\n\n    -   the first paragraph of **Analytic sample** (page 2) for the eligibility criteria, and\n    -   first and second paragraphs of **Study variables** for rest of the variables,\n    -   third paragraph of the **Statistical analyses** for the survey weights variable.\n\n    2.  eligibility criteria was determined based on **one** variable. Only work with 'YES' category.\n    3.  Outcome variable has a category 'NOT STATED', but for our analysis, we will omit anyone associated with this category.\n    4.  For explanatory variable, we have categories such as DON'T KNOW, REFUSAL and NOT STATED. We will not use these categories (omit anyone with these categories).\n    5.  There were **five** potential confounders.\n    6.

According to Thabane et al., there is a structured approach to do this, primarily using the PICOT and FINER frameworks.\n\n::: column-margin\n@thabane2009posing\n:::\n\n1.  **PICOT Framework**:\n\nThe PICOT framework helps to structure a specific and clear research question by focusing on five key elements:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table table-striped table-hover\" style=\"width: auto !important; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Element </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Description </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Example </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> P </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Population of Interest: Who is the target group you are studying? </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> US adults </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> I </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Intervention: What is the main action, treatment, or variable you're looking at? </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Effect of having rheumatoid arthritis </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> C </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Comparison: Are you comparing the intervention against a control group or usual care? </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> People without rheumatoid arthritis </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> O </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Outcome of Interest: What specifically do you want to measure? </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Rate of cardiovascular diseases </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> T </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Time Frame: Over what time period will your study take place? </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 1999â€“2018 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: column-margin\nResearch Question: \"In US adults, does having rheumatoid arthritis, compared to those without rheumatoid arthritis, affect the rate of cardiovascular diseases during 1999--2018?\" based on @hossain2022association: [DOI: 10.1016/j.annepidem.2022.03.005](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annepidem.2022.03.005)\n:::\n\n2.  **FINER Criteria**:\n\nOnce we have formulated your research question with the help of the PICOT elements, we should evaluate it using the FINER criteria:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table table-striped table-hover\" style=\"width: auto !important; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n<caption>FINER Criteria</caption>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Element </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Description </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> F </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Feasible: Is it possible to conduct this research with available resources? </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> I </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Interesting: Is the research question intriguing to the scientific community? </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> N </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Novel: Is the question original and not already thoroughly researched? </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> E </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Ethical: Is the research ethically sound? </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> R </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Relevant: Is the research currently needed or will it fill a gap in existing knowledge? </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe key takeaway is: Use the PICOT and FINER frameworks to guide you in framing a compelling, ethical, and achievable research question.\n\n::: column-margin\nRefer to the ['Scientific Writing for Health Research' book chapter](https://ehsanx.github.io/Scientific-Writing-for-Health-Research/research-question.html) for more details and examples.\n:::\n\n::: callout-note\nWe include 2 types of tutorials that emphasize the critical steps of **data preparation** and analysis tailored to specific research questions, cosidering the PICOT framework. They underscore the importance of refining and cleaning datasets to ensure their suitability for rigorous analytical procedures. The analyses, while rooted in distinct methodologies, converge on the common goal of deriving meaningful insights and ensuring the integrity and validity of the results obtained from the processed analytical data.\n:::\n\n::: column-margin\n**Data preparation**: Merging, reformatting and recategorizing essential variables to create a dataset suitable for analysis, aligning it with the study's objectives.\n:::\n\n::: callout-important\n**Datasets**:\n\nAll of the datasets used in this tutorial can be accessed from [this GitHub repository folder](https://github.com/ehsanx/EpiMethods/tree/main/Data/researchquestion)\n:::\n\n## Predictive questions\n\nThe [first tutorial](researchquestion1.html) serves to educate the user on how to utilize the RHC dataset to answer a **predictive** research question: developing a prediction model for the length of stay. The tutorial equips users with the skills to clean and process raw data, transforming it into an analyzable format, and introduces concepts that will be foundational for subsequent analysis.\n\nThe second tutorial ([part a for downloading](researchquestion2a.html) and [part b for analyzing](researchquestion2b.html)) provides an in-depth guide on how to build a **predictive** model for Diastolic blood pressure using the NHANES dataset for the years 2013-14.\n\n## Causal questions\n\nThe [third tutorial](researchquestion3.html) aims to guide a study on the relationship between Osteoarthritis (OA) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) among Canadian adults from 2001-2005. Utilizing the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) cycle 1.1-3.1, the study intends to explore whether OA **increases** (more accurately, whether **associated** with) the risk of developing CVD.\n\nThe NHANES dataset was analyzed in this [forth tutorial](researchquestion4.html) to explore the relationship between health predictors and cholesterol levels (**association/causal**). After refining the survey design and handling missing data, regression models were built using varying predictors. Standard error computations and p-values were derived, adjusting for the survey's unique structure.\n\n::: callout-tip\n**Optional Content**:\n\nYou'll find that some sections conclude with an optional video walkthrough that demonstrates the code. Keep in mind that the content might have been updated since these videos were recorded.

LaTeX is designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation, such as book, articles. \n\nGet an account in ShareLaTeX/[Overleaf](https://v2.overleaf.com/login).\n\n### Table conversion\n\nFrom MS word to latex / markdown / HTML in [TablesGenerator](http://www.tablesgenerator.com/).\n\nYou can use `tableone` package to generate csv file, and then import them in the TablesGenerator to convert to HTML to paste to doc file!\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntab1x <- print(tab1, quote = FALSE, noSpaces = TRUE, printToggle = FALSE)\nwrite.csv(tab1x, file = \"tab1x.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Fancy table and chart generators:\n\nR Packages\n\n-   [officer](https://davidgohel.github.io/officer/)\n-   [officedown](https://davidgohel.github.io/officedown/)\n-   [flextable](https://ardata-fr.github.io/flextable-book/)\n-   [mschart](https://ardata-fr.github.io/mschart/)\n\n### Drawing flow chart\n\n[draw.io](https://www.draw.io/.)\n\n### Presentation\n\nThe \"xaringan\" package, derived from a love for the Japanese manga and anime \"Naruto\", serves as an R Markdown extension, and it facilitates the creation of distinctively styled HTML5 presentations by leveraging the JavaScript library remark.js. Originating from an intent to produce a unique, though not widely adopted style, due to its potentially challenging pronunciation unless familiar with the anime, \"xaringan\" offers significant customizability in presentation design and has garnered additional theme contributions from its user community. Despite only supporting Markdown, \"xaringan\" enhances remark.js by introducing support for R Markdown and additional utilities, simplifying the slide-building and previewing processes. Further insights into \"xaringan\", its background, and its utility can be explored through its [documentation](http://slides.yihui.name/xaringan/).\n\n### Gantt charts\n\n[officetimeline](https://online.officetimeline.com/)\n\n### Simultaneous collaborative writing\n\n[Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/) offers a platform for real-time collaborative writing. Multiple users can edit documents simultaneously, and changes are saved automatically. Note that [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/) requires sign-in for a Google account.   \n\n-   Commenting and Suggesting: Use the comment and suggest features to provide feedback without altering the original text.\n-   Revision History: Navigate through the revision history to view changes and revert to previous versions if needed.\n-   Sharing and Permissions: Manage who can view, comment, or edit the document with varied permission levels.\n\n### Reference manager\n\n[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) stands out as a free, open-source reference management software that assists researchers, academics, and students in organizing, managing, and formatting their citations and bibliographies. It's not just a reference manager but also a powerful tool for collaborative work on research projects. Try the [Zotero desktop manager](https://www.zotero.org/download/) as well for assisting with reference inserting.\n\nZotero syncs data across devices, ensuring that users can access their libraries from any location. Users can work offline with Zotero, and any changes made will be synchronized when the internet connection is restored.\n\n[ZoteroBib](https://zbib.org/): Use ZoteroBib to generate bibliographies instantly without creating an account or installing software.\n\n### Article formatting\n\nThe `rticles` package in R provides a diverse selection of templates for creating academic articles and is easily accessible directly within the RStudio environment by navigating through **File -\\> New File -\\> R Markdown**, where users can select their desired template. For users not utilizing RStudio, the installation of Pandoc is requisite, with articles being creatable using the `rmarkdown::draft()` function, and specifying the template and package parameters as needed. Additionally, the package enables viewing a list of available journal names using `rticles::journals()`. To employ enhanced features, such as automatic figure numbering and cross-referencing of tables, users can utilize functionalities from the `bookdown` package. This involves adjusting the YAML to use `bookdown::pdf_book` as the output format, and designating the chosen `rticles` template as the `base_format`. Comprehensive details and tutorials regarding the use of the `rticles` package can be found in its online documentation. The complete array of options can be explored within the R Markdown templates window in RStudio, via the packages's [GitHub readme](https://github.com/rstudio/rticles) or accessed programmatically via the following function:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrticles::journals()\n#>  [1] \"acm\"            \"acs\"            \"aea\"            \"agu\"           \n#>  [5] \"ajs\"

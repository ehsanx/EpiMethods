We will use Right Heart Catheterization Dataset saved in the folder named 'Data/wrangling/'. The variable list and description can be accessed from [Vanderbilt Biostatistics website](https://biostat.app.vumc.org/wiki/pub/Main/DataSets/rhc.html).\n\nA paper you can access the original table from [this paper](https://jamanetwork-com.ezproxy.library.ubc.ca/journals/jama/fullarticle/407990) ([doi: 10.1001/jama.1996.03540110043030](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8782638/)). We have modified the table and corrected some issues.

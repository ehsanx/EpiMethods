# Confounding and bias

This chapter is about:

## Understanding and adjustment of confounding


The tutorial explores the concept of confounding in the context of big data, specifically with one million observations. The data is then generated based on specified DAGs and analyzed using generalized linear models to estimate the treatment effect. The tutorial investigates how the presence or absence of adjusting for confounder impacts the estimation of the true treatment effect.

## Mediator

The tutorial focuses on the role of a mediator variable in estimating treatment effects. The tutorial assesses how adjusting for the mediator influences the estimated treatment effect, exploring both non-null and null true treatment effect scenarios.

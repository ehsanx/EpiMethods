## App (W) {.unnumbered}

Below is an example of an app that utilizes the `mpg` dataset from the `ggplot2` package following the [tutorial materials](wrangling5.html). Users can subset the data and generate a stratified Table 1 from it.

**Web App may need some time to load the necessary files, depending on your internet speed.**

If you want to run the app locally in your computer instead for faster load time: you can download the app directly in your R via `shiny::runGitHub("EpiShinyLiveW", "ehsanx", subdir = "app")`. Make sure that `shiny`, `tableone` and `ggplot2` packages are installed in your computer/R.

## Concepts (A) {.unnumbered}

## Model-based approach

The model-based approach to statistical analysis is heavily reliant on the specification of a probability model for data generation, typically assuming that data come from an infinite population that follows a specific distribution, such as the Normal distribution. Inferences about the population, including point estimates and hypothesis testing, are made based on how well the sample data fit these model assumptions. 

## Design-based approach

The design-based approach emphasizes the use of sampling methods and the design of the study itself to make inferences about a real/finite population. The design-based approach takes into account the actual structure of the data collection process to make inferences, ensuring that each unit in the population has a known and often non-zero chance of being included in the sample, thus addressing the potential biases and variance issues arising from the sampling design. This approach is critical in understanding and analyzing data from surveys with complex designs, including those with stratification, clustering, and weighting.

If you want to run the app locally in your computer instead for faster load time: you can download the app directly in your R via `shiny::runGitHub("EpiShinyLiveA", "ehsanx", subdir = "app")`. Make sure that `shiny`, `nhanesA`, `DataExplorer`, `Hmisc`, `dplyr`, and `tableone` packages are installed in your computer/R.

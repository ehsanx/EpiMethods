# Research question

We include 2 tutorials that emphasize the critical steps of data preparation and analysis tailored to specific research questions. They underscore the importance of refining and cleaning datasets to ensure their suitability for rigorous analytical procedures. The analyses, while rooted in distinct methodologies, converge on the common goal of deriving meaningful insights and ensuring the integrity and validity of the results obtained from the processed analytical data.


## RHC data

The tutorial serves to educate the user on how to utilize the RHC dataset to answer a research question: developing a prediction model for the length of stay. The tutorial equips users with the skills to clean and process raw data, transforming it into an analyzable format, and introduces concepts that will be foundational for subsequent analysis.

## NHANES data 

The NHANES dataset was analyzed in this tutorial to explore the relationship between health predictors and cholesterol levels. After refining the survey design and handling missing data, regression models were built using varying predictors. Standard error computations and p-values were derived, adjusting for the survey's unique structure.

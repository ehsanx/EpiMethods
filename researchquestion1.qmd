This tutorial delves into processing and understanding the RHC dataset, which pertains to patients in the intensive care unit. The dataset is particularly centered around the implications of using right heart catheterization (RHC) in the early phases of care, with a focus on comparing two patient groups: those who received the RHC procedure and those who did not. The key outcome being analyzed is the 30-day survival rate. We will use this as an example to explain how to work with a predictive research question to build the analytic data.

[@connors1996effectiveness] published an article in [JAMA](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama). The article is about managing or guiding therapy for the critically ill patients in the intensive care unit. They considered a number of **health-outcomes** such as

-   *length of stay* (hospital stay; measured continuously)
-   *death* within certain period (death at any time up to 180 Days; measured as a binary variable)

The original article was concerned about the association of right heart catheterization *(RHC)* use during the first 24 hours of care in the intensive care unit and the health-outcomes mentioned above, but we will use this data as a case study for our **prediction modelling**. Traditional PICOT framework is designed primarily for clinical questions related to interventions, so when applying it to other areas like predictive modeling, some creative adaptation is needed.

|------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **P**      | Patients who are critically ill                      |
| **I**      | Not applicable, as we are dealing with a prediction model here        |
| **C**      |  Not applicable, as we are dealing with a prediction model here   |
| **O**      | in-hospital mortality                          |
| **T**      | Between 1989 to 1994 (see the JAMA paper)                           |

Let us download the dataset and save it for later use.

```{r download, cache=TRUE}
# Load the dataset
ObsData <- read.csv("https://hbiostat.org/data/repo/rhc.csv", header = TRUE)

# Save the dataset
saveRDS(ObsData, file = "Data/researchquestion/rhc.RDS")
```

### Creating analytic data

Now, we show the process of preparing analytic data, so that the variables generally match with the way the authors were coded in the original article. Below we show the process of creating the analytic data.

#### Add column for outcome: length of stay

```{r addcol, cache=TRUE}
# Length.of.Stay = date of discharge - study admission date
ObsData$Length.of.Stay <- ObsData$dschdte - ObsData$sadmdte

# Length.of.Stay = date of death - study admission date if date of discharge not available
ObsData$Length.of.Stay[is.na(ObsData$Length.of.Stay)] <- 
  ObsData$dthdte[is.na(ObsData$Length.of.Stay)] - 
  ObsData$sadmdte[is.na(ObsData$Length.of.Stay)]
```

#### Recoding column for outcome: death

::: callout-tip
Here we use the `ifelse` function to create a categorical variable. Other related functions are `cut`, `car`.
:::

Let us recode our outcome variable as a binary variable:

```{r recode, cache=TRUE}
ObsData$death <- ifelse(ObsData$death == "Yes", 1, 0)
```

#### Remove unnecessary outcomes

Our next task is to remove unnecessary outcomes:

::: callout-tip
There are multiple ways to drop variables from a dataset. E.g., without using any package and using the `select` function from the dplyr package.
:::

```{r remove, cache=TRUE}
ObsData <- dplyr::select(ObsData, !c(dthdte, lstctdte, dschdte, 
                            t3d30, dth30, surv2md1))
```

#### Remove unnecessary and problematic variables

Now we will drop unnecessary and problematic variables:

```{r remove2, cache=TRUE}
ObsData <- dplyr::select(ObsData, !c(sadmdte, ptid, X, adld3p, urin1, cat2))
```

#### Basic data cleanup

Now we will do some basic cleanup.

::: callout-tip
We an use the `lapply` function to convert all categorical variables to factors at once. Not that a similar function to `lapply` is `sapply`. The main difference is that sapply attempts to convert the result into a vector or matrix, while lapply returns a list.
:::

```{r cleanup, cache=TRUE}
# convert all categorical variables to factors
factors <- c("cat1", "ca", "death", "cardiohx", "chfhx", 
             "dementhx", "psychhx", "chrpulhx", "renalhx", 
             "liverhx", "gibledhx", "malighx", "immunhx", 
             "transhx", "amihx", "sex", "dnr1", "ninsclas", 
             "resp", "card", "neuro", "gastr", "renal", "meta", 
             "hema", "seps", "trauma", "ortho", "race", 
             "income")
ObsData[factors] <- lapply(ObsData[factors], as.factor)

# convert RHC.use (RHC vs. No RHC) to a binary variable
ObsData$RHC.use <- ifelse(ObsData$swang1 == "RHC", 1, 0)
ObsData <- dplyr::select(ObsData, !swang1)

# Categorize the variables to match with the original paper
ObsData$age <- cut(ObsData$age, breaks=c(-Inf, 50, 60, 70, 80, Inf),
                   right=FALSE)
ObsData$race <- factor(ObsData$race, levels=c("white","black","other"))
ObsData$sex <- as.factor(ObsData$sex)
ObsData$sex <- relevel(ObsData$sex, ref = "Male")
ObsData$cat1 <- as.factor(ObsData$cat1)
levels(ObsData$cat1) <- c("ARF","CHF","Other","Other","Other",
                          "Other","Other","MOSF","MOSF")
ObsData$ca <- as.factor(ObsData$ca)
levels(ObsData$ca) <- c("Metastatic","None","Localized (Yes)")
ObsData$ca <- factor(ObsData$ca, levels=c("None", "Localized (Yes)",
                                          "Metastatic"))
```

#### Rename variables

```{r rename2, cache=TRUE}
# Rename the variables
names(ObsData) <- c("Disease.category", "Cancer", "Death", "Cardiovascular", 
                    "Congestive.HF", "Dementia", "Psychiatric", "Pulmonary", 
                    "Renal", "Hepatic", "GI.Bleed", "Tumor", 
                    "Immunosupperssion", "Transfer.hx", "MI", "age", "sex", 
                    "edu", "DASIndex", "APACHE.score", "Glasgow.Coma.Score", 
                    "blood.pressure", "WBC", "Heart.rate", "Respiratory.rate", 
                    "Temperature", "PaO2vs.FIO2", "Albumin", "Hematocrit", 
                    "Bilirubin", "Creatinine", "Sodium", "Potassium", "PaCo2", 
                    "PH", "Weight", "DNR.status", "Medical.insurance", 
                    "Respiratory.Diag", "Cardiovascular.Diag", 
                    "Neurological.Diag", "Gastrointestinal.Diag", "Renal.Diag",
                    "Metabolic.Diag", "Hematologic.Diag", "Sepsis.Diag", 
                    "Trauma.Diag", "Orthopedic.Diag", "race", "income", 
                    "Length.of.Stay", "RHC.use")

# Save the dataset
saveRDS(ObsData, file = "Data/researchquestion/rhcAnalytic.RDS")
```

### Notations

let us introduce with some notations:

| Notations               | Example in RHC study  |
|-------------------------|-----------------------|
| $Y_1$: Observed outcome | length of stay        |
| $Y_2$: Observed outcome | death within 3 months |
| $L$: Covariates         | See below             |

### Basic data exploration

#### Dimension

Let us the how many rows and columns we have:

```{r dim, cache=TRUE}
dim(ObsData)
```

#### Comprehensive summary

Let us see the summary statistics of the variables:

::: callout-tip
To see the comprehensive summary of the variables, we can use the `skim` function form skimr package or `describe` function from rms package
:::

```{r summary, cache=TRUE}
require(skimr)
skim(ObsData)
```

### Predictive vs. causal models

The focus of current document is predictive models (e.g., predicting a health outcome).

```{r plot27777, echo=FALSE, out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/researchquestion/dagpred.png")
```

The original article by @connors1996effectiveness focused on the association of

::: column-margin
@connors1996effectiveness
:::

-   right heart catheterization *(RHC)* use during the first 24 hours of care in the intensive care unit (exposure of primary interest) and
-   the health-outcomes (such as length of stay).

```{r plot27777g, echo=FALSE, out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/researchquestion/dagci.png")
```

Then the PICOT table changes as follows:

| Aspect     | Description                                          |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **P**      | Patients who are critically ill                      |
| **I**      | Receiving a right heart catheterization (RHC)        |
| **C**      | Not receiving a right heart catheterization (RHC)    |
| **O**      | length of stay                          |
| **T**      | Between 1989 to 1994 (see the JAMA paper)                           |

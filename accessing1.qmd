## Complex survey data {.unnumbered}

### Description

Surveys are designed to gather and assess national level health-related information. Usually governments collect these data, and make some effort to publish a version of the data for researchers to use. In this document, we will talk about various survey designs, some examples, how to download some of these data sources from Canadian and US sources. An example is included at the end regarding how to reproduce results from a paper that used one of these open data sources.

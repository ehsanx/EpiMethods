## Justification {.unnumbered}

We must show enough justification to do a mediation analysis. A causal diagram would be the first step to conceptualize the mediation analysis problem hypothetically. Then, we can empirically verify where doing the mediation analysis makes sense in that particular context. 

```{r setup, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
# Load required packages
require(survey)
require(DiagrammeR)
require(DiagrammeRsvg)
require(rsvg)
library(magrittr)
library(svglite)
library(png)
```

### Pre-processing

#### Load saved data

```{r loading, eval=TRUE, cache=TRUE }
load("Data/mediation/cchs123pain.RData")
```

#### Prepared the data

```{r prepare, eval=TRUE, cache=TRUE }
analytic.miss$mediator <- ifelse(analytic.miss$painmed == "Yes", 1, 0)
analytic.miss$exposure <- ifelse(analytic.miss$OA == "OA", 1, 0)
analytic.miss$outcome <- ifelse(analytic.miss$CVD == "event", 1, 0)
```

### Notation

-   Outcome ($Y$): Cardiovascular disease (CVD)
-   Exposure ($A$): Osteoarthritis (OA)
-   Mediator ($M$): Pain medication
-   Adjustment covariates ($C$)

### Hypothesis

1.  For total effect (TE): Is OA ($A$) associated with CVD ($Y$)?

```{r h00, echo=FALSE,cache=TRUE}
sampling0 <- grViz("
	digraph causal {
	
	  # Nodes
	  node [shape = egg]
    A [label = 'Osteoarthritis']
    Y [label = 'Cardiovascular Disease']
    #M [label = 'Pain medication']
    node [shape = perpendicular]
    C [label = 'Demographics, \n Important confounders, \n Relation with other diseases ']
    
	  # Edges
	  edge [color = black,
	        arrowhead = vee]
	  #rankdir = LR
    #A -> M -> Y
    A -> Y [label = 'TE']
    C -> {A, Y}

	  # Graph
	  graph [overlap = true, fontsize = 10]
	}")
sampling0 %>% export_svg %>% charToRaw %>% rsvg %>% png::writePNG("images/mediation/H00relation.png", dpi = 100)
```

```{r h00plot, echo=FALSE, out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/mediation/H00relation.png")
```

2.  For mediation analysis: Does pain-medication ($M$) play a mediating role in the causal pathway between OA ($A$) and CVD ($Y$)? Here, we will decompose total effect (TE) to a natural direct effect (NDE) and a natural indirect effect (NIE).

```{r h01, echo=FALSE,cache=TRUE}
sampling0 <- grViz("
	digraph causal {
	
	  # Nodes
	  node [shape = egg]
    A [label = 'Osteoarthritis']
    Y [label = 'Cardiovascular Disease']
    node [shape = perpendicular]
    C [label = 'Demographics, \n Important confounders, \n Relation with other diseases ']
    M [label = 'Pain medication']
    
	  # Edges
	  edge [color = black,
	        arrowhead = vee]
	  #rankdir = LR
    A -> M [label = 'NIE']
    M -> Y   
    A -> Y [label = 'NDE']
    C -> {A, M, Y}

	  # Graph
	  graph [overlap = true, fontsize = 10]
	}")
sampling0 %>% export_svg %>% charToRaw %>% rsvg %>% png::writePNG("Images/mediation/H01relation.png", dpi = 100)
```

```{r h01plot, echo=FALSE, out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/mediation/H01relation.png")
```

Adjustment variables ($C$):

-   Demographics
    -   age
    -   sex
    -   income
    -   race
    -   education status
-   Important confounders
    -   BMI
    -   physical activity
    -   smoking status
    -   fruit and vegetable consumption
-   Relation with other diseases
    -   hypertension
    -   COPD
    -   diabetes

### Analysis/empirical exploration 

#### Total effect

Outcome model (weighted) is

$logit [P(Y_{a}=1 | C = c] = \theta_0 + \theta_1 a + \theta_3 c$

#### Setting Design

```{r design, cache=TRUE}
require(survey)
summary(analytic.miss$weight)

# Survey design
w.design0 <- svydesign(id=~1, weights=~weight, data=analytic.miss)
summary(weights(w.design0))
sd(weights(w.design0))

# Subset the design
w.design <- subset(w.design0, miss == 0)
summary(weights(w.design))
sd(weights(w.design))
```

```{r te, eval=TRUE, cache=TRUE}
# Model
TE <- svyglm(outcome ~ exposure + age + sex + income + race + bmi + edu + phyact + 
               smoke + fruit + diab, design = w.design, family = quasibinomial("logit"))
# painmed is mediator; not included here.
TE.save <- exp(c(summary(TE)$coef["exposure",1], 
                confint(TE)["exposure",]))
TE.save
```

Exposure to OA has a detrimental effect on CVD risk (significant!).

#### Effect on the mediators

```{r mediator, eval=TRUE, cache=TRUE}
fit.m = svyglm(mediator ~ exposure + age + sex + income + race + bmi + edu +
                 phyact + smoke + fruit + diab, design = w.design,
               family = binomial("logit"))
med.save <- exp(c(summary(fit.m)$coef["exposure",1], confint(fit.m)["exposure",]))
med.save
```

Exposure to OA has a substantial effect on the mediator (Pain medication) as well (significant!). Hence, it would be interesting to explore a mediation analysis to assess the mediating role.

### Save data

```{r save, results='hide'}
save(w.design, file = "Data/mediation/cchs123painW.RData")
```
